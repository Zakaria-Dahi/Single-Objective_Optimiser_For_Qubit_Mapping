# Quick Description

**Programmers :shipit:**: Zakaria Abdelmoiz DAHI from the University of Malaga, Spain. 

**About:** This repositiory implements an evolutonary algorithm devised in [1] for optimising qubits' initialisation in IBM machines.

## **How :green_book:** 

- In the folder `code`, you can find folders having as name the percentage of entanglement `0.25`, `0.50`, ...
- Choose one of them. In each fo them, you will find a folder having as name the number of qubits in the used machine, `7`, `16`, `20`, ...
- Each subfolder contains two files and one folder:
    - Results: contains the results of the experiments.
    - `main.py`: is the code of the devised approach
    - `launch.sh`: is dedicated to slurm-based cluster execution.
    - If you want to run some code, just run its corresponding `main.py`.


## **Folders Hiearchy :open_file_folder:**
    
- Code:
    - `0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00`: contains the code when using the corresponding entanglement percentage:
        - `7, 16, 20, 20, 27, 53, 65`: contains the code according to the number of the qubits in the machine.
